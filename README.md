- ‚ö° Parallel processing for fast analysis
- üí° Contextual feedback for detected issues

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Google Cloud Vision API

1. Enable Vision API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/vision.googleapis.com
2. Enable billing (first 1,000 requests/month are free)
3. Create API Key: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
